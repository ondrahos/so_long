## so_long Project Summary

### Project Overview

The so_long project is a game development project that involves creating a simple 2D game using the MLX42 graphical library. The objective is to build a game where a player navigates through a map, collects items, and reaches a goal.

### Key Objectives

- Implement basic game mechanics such as player movement, item collection, and collision detection.
- Utilize the MLX42 library to handle graphics, window management, and user inputs.
- Design and render a visually appealing game environment using textures.
- Ensure game functionality is robust and bug-free through thorough testing and debugging.

### Core Features

1. **Game Mechanics:**
   - Player movement controls (up, down, left, right).
   - Collision detection with walls.
   - Collectible item placement and collection.

2. **Graphics and Rendering:**
   - Rendering the game world with textures.
   - Displaying player character, items, walls and other elements.

3. **Input Handling:**
   - Capturing user inputs for controlling the player character.
   - Handling keyboard events for game interactions and navigation.

4. **Map Parsing and Validation:**
   - Parsing map data from a file to generate the game environment.
   - Validating map structure and contents for correctness and consistency.

5. **Error Handling and Debugging:**
   - Implementing error handling mechanisms to deal with runtime errors gracefully.
   - Debugging and troubleshooting to identify and fix issues in the game logic or rendering.

### Benefits

- Enhances understanding of game development principles and techniques.
- Provides hands-on experience with graphics programming and user interaction.
- Fosters problem-solving skills through debugging and optimizing game performance.

### Conclusion

The so_long project offers an exciting opportunity to explore game development concepts and hone programming skills in a fun and interactive way. By completing this project, students gain valuable experience in building games from scratch and lay the foundation for further exploration in the field of game development.
