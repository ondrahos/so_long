## so_long Project Summary

### Project Overview

The so_long project is a game development project that involves creating a simple 2D game using the MinilibX graphical library. The objective is to build a game where a player navigates through a map, collects items, and reaches a goal while avoiding obstacles.

### Key Objectives

- Implement basic game mechanics such as player movement, item collection, and collision detection.
- Utilize the MinilibX library to handle graphics, window management, and user inputs.
- Design and render a visually appealing game environment using sprites and textures.
- Ensure game functionality is robust and bug-free through thorough testing and debugging.

### Core Features

1. **Game Mechanics:**
   - Player movement controls (up, down, left, right).
   - Collision detection with walls and obstacles.
   - Collectible item placement and collection.
   - Game state transitions (start screen, in-game, game over, victory).

2. **Graphics and Rendering:**
   - Rendering the game world with textures and sprites.
   - Displaying player character, items, obstacles, and other elements.
   - Implementing animations and visual effects to enhance gameplay experience.

3. **Input Handling:**
   - Capturing user inputs for controlling the player character.
   - Handling keyboard events for game interactions and navigation.

4. **Map Parsing and Validation:**
   - Parsing map data from a file to generate the game environment.
   - Validating map structure and contents for correctness and consistency.

5. **Error Handling and Debugging:**
   - Implementing error handling mechanisms to deal with runtime errors gracefully.
   - Debugging and troubleshooting to identify and fix issues in the game logic or rendering.

### Benefits

- Enhances understanding of game development principles and techniques.
- Provides hands-on experience with graphics programming and user interaction.
- Fosters problem-solving skills through debugging and optimizing game performance.

### Conclusion

The so_long project offers an exciting opportunity to explore game development concepts and hone programming skills in a fun and interactive way. By completing this project, students at 42 School gain valuable experience in building games from scratch and lay the foundation for further exploration in the field of game development.
